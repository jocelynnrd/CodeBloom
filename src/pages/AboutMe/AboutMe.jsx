        Hi! I'm Jocelyn, a passionate web developer with a love for building responsive, user-friendly web apps. 
        I specialize in React, JavaScript, and creating polished, mobile-first designs. When I'm not coding, I 
        enjoy [add a hobby or fun fact here, like "binge-watching movies" or "exploring nature"]!
